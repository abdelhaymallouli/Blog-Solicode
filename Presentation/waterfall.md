# The Core Concept 🌊

> "Sequence is the key to stability."

* **Linear:** One direction only.
* **Structured:** Finish one step before the next.

# Phase 1: Planning 📋*

* **Requirements:** Define every feature.
* **System Design:** Build the technical roadmap.
* **Goal:** Create a solid foundation.

---

# Phase 2: Execution 💻

* **Implementation:** Coding the solution.
* **Testing:** Verifying against original specs.
* **Goal:** High-quality code delivery.

---

# Phase 3: Finalization 🚀

* **Deployment:** Moving to production.
* **Maintenance:** Fixing bugs and updates.
* **Goal:** Long-term system health.

---

# Strategic Strengths ✅

* **Clear Milestones:** Easy to track progress.
* **Disciplined:** High documentation standards.
* **Budget Friendly:** Best for fixed-price contracts.

---

# Strategic Risks ❌

* **Rigid:** Changes are costly.
* **Late Testing:** Bugs found at the end.
* **High Barrier:** Client only sees the end product.

---

# Best Use Cases 🎯
